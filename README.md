# Guess the Grid

A letter-guessing game built using Python.

## How to Play

You have 6 attempts to guess the word. After each guess, you'll receive feedback on the accuracy of your guess:

- **Pink**: Letter is in the correct place.
- **Orange**: Letter exists in the word but is in the wrong place.
- **Blue**: Letter does not exist in the word.

Keep guessing until you either find the word or run out of attempts!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x must be installed on your system.

To check if Python is installed, open your terminal and run:

```bash
python --version
